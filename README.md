# ðŸš€GitHub AutomatorðŸš€

The GitHub Automator is a Rust-based tool designed to streamline and automate common Git operations on GitHub repositories. Whether you're adding, committing, and pushing changes, generating commit messages, or managing pull requests, this tool simplifies the process, saving you time and effort.

## Features

- **Automated Git Operations**: Perform common Git operations, such as adding files, committing changes, and pushing commits, with ease and efficiency.
- **Commit Message Generation**: Generate meaningful commit messages automatically, eliminating the need for manual entry and ensuring consistency across commits.
- **GitHub Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with GitHub repositories, enabling smooth interaction with remote repositories and pull requests.
- **Customization Options**: Tailor the tool to your needs with customizable settings for commit message generation, branch management, and more.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Enjoy a user-friendly command-line interface that makes Git operations intuitive and accessible.

## ðŸ”§ How It Works ðŸ”§

The GitHub Automator utilizes Rust's robust libraries to interact with Git and GitHub. Hereâ€™s a high-level overview of its workflow:

- **Initialization**: The tool initializes a Git repository (if not already initialized) and sets the remote origin based on the provided repository link.
- **Adding Changes**: It stages all changes in the repository using the git add -A command.
- **Status Check**: The tool executes git status to display the current status of the repository, ensuring all changes are staged correctly.
- **Commit Changes**: A commit is made with an automatically generated commit message using a names generator.
- **Push Changes**: Finally, the tool pushes the committed changes to the specified branch (defaulting to master if no branch is specified).

## ðŸš€Getting Started ðŸš€

1. **Install the Tool:**
```bash
cargo install git_automate
```
2. **Add to Your Project:**
```bash
cargo add git_automate
```
3. **Configure Your Setup:** Set up with your GitHub credentials and repository info.
4. **Automate Your Workflow:** Use the command-line interface to streamline your Git operations.

## Command-Line Arguments

- `--link` or `-l`: The URL of the GitHub repository. This sets the remote origin if not already set.
- `--branch` or `-b`: The branch name to push to. If not specified, defaults to `master`.
- `--help` or `-h`: Displays this help message and exits. Use this option to get information about the available command-line arguments and their usage.
